# Leads Pipeline (CRM)

The Leads Pipeline is the heart of the customer relationship management system in Ettutu V2. It
lets you visualize and manage your sales process using a Kanban-style board.

## Accessing the Pipeline

Navigate to **CRM → Pipeline** in the sidebar.

---

## Pipeline Stages

The default pipeline consists of six standard sales stages:

1. **New**: Freshly identified leads that have not yet been contacted.
1. **Contacted**: Leads that you have reached out to (email, phone, LinkedIn).
1. **Qualified**: Leads that have responded and fit your ideal customer profile.
1. **Proposal**: Leads to whom you have sent a proposal or quote.
1. **Negotiation**: Active discussions on terms and pricing.
1. **Closed**: Deals won (or lost).

## Lead Cards

Each card on the board represents a lead and typically displays:

- **Company Name**
- **Key Contact** (if available)
- **Deal Value** (estimated)
- **Next Task** due date
- **Tags** (e.g., "High Volume", "Urgent")

---

## Actions

### Move Leads Between Stages

- **Drag and Drop**: Drag a card from one column to another to update its stage.

### Add a Lead Manually

- **Quick Add**: Click the **Add Lead** button to create a lead without going through the search
  process.

### Focus the Board

- **Filtering**: Filter the board by Assignee, Priority, or Deal Value to focus on what matters.

## Integration with Records

Leads in the pipeline are promoted from the **Records** pool:

- When a record is **Sent to CRM**, it becomes a lead card in the **New** column.
- Data enriched during the Search/Analyst phase (emails, phone, analysis) stays attached to the
  lead.

## Best Practices

- **Keep it clean**: Archive **Closed** deals regularly to focus on active opportunities.
- **Add tasks**: Every lead in active stages should have a **Next Task** assigned (e.g., "Follow up
  call").
- **Use notes**: Add notes to track conversation history and next steps.
